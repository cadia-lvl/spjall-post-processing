# spjall-post-processing
To start out, we will automate the submission and extraction flow of audio files to and from Tiro.
1. Automatically submit audio files from Spjall to Tiro's editor.
2. Then, automatically extract the transcript from Tiro for post-processing.


## Structure
List the contents/folder structure of the spjallromur directory.


## Packages and Installation
List packages required to run the scripts, and how to install them.


## Running
Steps to run the scripts.


## Statistics
To add:
- Number of speakers
- Total duration of speech
- Demographics (gender, age range, native and second language speakers)


## Notes
- Each participant's recording shall be coordinated with other participants' recordings. These files shall be converted to .wav files where there is one channel for each participant. 
- Participants have the option of marking portions they do not want included in published data. These portions can be 'beeped' or cut out using tools such as Audacity.
- Each participant has their own .json file, where their portion of the conversation is written.
- Files should be named as follows:
  - Audio files: convo_XXXX.wav, e.g. convo_0001.
  - Text files: speaker_X_convo_XXXX.json, e.g. speaker_1_convo_0001.json
- There should only be a single point of entry for users.
